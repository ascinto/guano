# Supplementary data tables are available as .csv files. In addition, code executed using the AMPtk pipeline (used to take raw Illumina reads and ultimately assign taxonomy to unique OTUs) is available as a Jupyter Notebook - see **nau_amptk_pipeline.ipynb**. A single R script was used to generate data tables and figures shared - see **otu_analysis.R**.  

Please contact me should you have any questions.
